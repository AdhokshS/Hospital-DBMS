# Hospital Database Management System

## Overview

Created a robust SQL-based database management solution specifically for the healthcare industry, transforming hospital operations by streamlining patient data administration and improving care delivery. This project, developed as part of an enterprise database management course, displays sophisticated relational database capabilities for streamlining important healthcare operations while maintaining scalability, data integrity, and increased operational efficiency.

## Features

### Database Design
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram**: Provides a logical view of the database structure.
- **Relational Diagram**: Offers a physical view of how tables are interconnected.
- **Tables**: Detailed SQL commands for creating and populating tables including `Department`, `Employee`, `Patient`, `LabTest`, and `PatientBill`.

### Data Management
- **Data Storage**: Efficiently stores patient, employee, department, and visit records.
- **Data Relationships**: Utilizes foreign keys to represent relationships between tables.

### Analytics and Reporting
- **SQL Queries**: Analytical queries to extract insights such as patient visit counts, total billing, preferred payment methods, and employee performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualization of key metrics using Python and Tableau.
- **Python Visualization**: Interactive data exploration and visualization using Python.
- **Tableau Dashboards**: Comprehensive dashboards for real-time data visualization.

### Deployment
- **AWS RDS**: Deployment on Amazon Web Services Relational Database Service for scalable and secure database management.
